# vuejs3

This project demonstrates fetching data from the WordPress REST API using Vue 3.

Open `index.html` in a browser to see the latest posts from [WordPress.org News](https://wordpress.org/news/).

The page includes basic SEO enhancements such as meta tags, canonical links, Open Graph data and semantic markup for each post so search engines can index the content.


Click a post title to open `post.html`, which fetches and renders that single post based on its ID in the query string.
